# Library-Website

It is a un-finished Library-Website

Basically, I built it up with Python, HTML5, Python  3.0,, Django, Pycharm, and some CSS template.

It includes the function for users to search books, to borrow, and to chech it's status. Also, it has the functions for clerks to check the borrow history and the INSERT/UPDATE/CREATE in SQL query with sqlite.
